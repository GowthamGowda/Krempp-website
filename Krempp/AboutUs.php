    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Welcome to Krempp Lumber  Company, a family owned business, serving Southern Indiana for over 100 years.</strong>  We serve builders as well as do-it-yourself home owners. We are a full service home improvement business offering all your building material needs including kitchen cabinets and tops, lumber and various specialties, roofing, paint, windows, doors, flooring, a professional sales team, delivery and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It all started with 28 year old German immigrant Andrew Krempp moving to the U.S. in 1864 and eventually settling in Jasper, Indiana in 1876 to start a long history of Krempp&#8217;s (now 6 generations) in building materials and construction businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Building Materials and Construction Company operated in the early 1900&#8242;s as Traylor &amp; Krempp.  Andrew B. Krempp bought out Traylor in 1918, was joined by son Edwin in 1923, and formally incorporated as The Krempp Lumber Company in 1928.  Various businesses, including all types of construction and supply as well as manufacturing, were founded through The Krempp Lumber Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most notable was Stan Krempp&#8217;s  founding of the United Cabinet Corporation manufacturing prefinished modular kitchen cabinets.  This business grew rapidly and became very successfully as Aristokraft Cabinets (todays Masterbrands &#8211; still headquartered in Jasper, IN). Company evolved throughout the past century into general construction of large institutional and commercial projects and building materials supply. The construction division was spun off in 2010 as Krempp Construction, Inc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Krempp Lumber Company today is proudly operating under its 6&#8242;&#8221; generation in the building materials supply business and enjoys a reputation for honesty, value, quality products and outstanding service. <strong>Our primary focus is on the supply of high quality construction products to professional builders as well as do-it-yourself projects.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have stood the test of time through depressions and wars and look forward to another successful century serving our customers with honesty, value, quality products and great service. Come give us the opportunity to serve your building material needs.</p>
